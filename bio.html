 <p><strong>I am an aspiring author who has been writing fiction as a hobby for about five years. This past      year, I have set my discipline to prepare for publishing. I favor darker themes and anything with a historic twist. I am also a budding blogger and website designer who is currently pursuing a degree in Technical Communications.
<p>My stories are free to read and hosted on my blog <i>The Indie Horror Show.</i> I also host a site for interactive writing featuring in-character performances from talented writers called <i>The Eclipsed Quill</i>.
<p>I do have a few works for publishing in progress. My first novel, <i>The Black Butterfly</i> will be ready for submission by the end of 2015. I am also working on a co-authored piece entitled <i>Rosenrot Asylum.</i>
<p>I am interested in networking with other dark-themed writers and hunting for literary agents who are looking for submissions in the horror genre.<p> Feel free to get in touch!
